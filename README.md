# University-Projects
Source code for the programming projects I completed as part of my degree at The University of Manchester.

Reports for lab experiments and other projects (including the ones in this directory) are located within the
[Portfolio_Documents](https://github.com/RelativisticCanoe/portfolio_documents) repo.

"Z Boson Assignment" is a project in data analysis and data presentation in Python using NumPy and MatPlotLib.
"Spring Simulation" and "Neutron and Material Simulation" are projects in numerical simulation using Python/JupyterNotebook and integration of the data into longer-form reports.
"OOP in C++ Assignments" is a collection of work assessed as part of an OOP module taken as part of my degree.
